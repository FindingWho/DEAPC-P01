# DEAPC-P01
With this website we want to be able to put items for sale (by the owner or vendor)
we want to be able to list the products that are available for sale, put them in a virtual shopping cart
and buy them (as a client).
In addition to this we want to be able to see (as a vendor or owner) the amount of stock a product has
and request for more stock, with the ability for the owner to deny or approve.
The priority of work for this is to have a functioning website that is able to list products, so we deemed
that as the high prio. For a medium prio is to have an easy way for the owner or vendor to be able to add 
or remove products. The lowest prio is the stock management warnings and requests.
